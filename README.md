Creating a professional puzzle game involves several steps and depends on the platform and programming language you're using. Below is a simple example of a puzzle game using Python and the Pygame library. This example is a basic sliding puzzle game.

Feature of puzzle game

Puzzle games are a popular genre of video games that engage players in problem-solving activities, often requiring logical thinking, pattern recognition, and creativity. Here are some common features and characteristics of puzzle games:
1. **Problem Solving*: Puzzle games revolve around the core concept of problem-solving. Players are presented with challenges or puzzles that require creative thinking and strategic planning to solve.
2. **Logical Thinking**: Many puzzles demand logical reasoning and deductive skills. Players must analyze the information given, make connections, and come up with a solution based on sound reasoning.
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Puzzle games often involve recognizing patterns within the game environment or the puzzle itself. This can include visual patterns, sequences, or spatial arrangements.

4. **Trial and Error**: Players may need to experiment with different approaches and solutions to find the correct one. This trial-and-error process is a common element in puzzle games.

5. **Progressive Difficulty**: Puzzle games often feature a progression of difficulty, starting with easier puzzles and gradually increasing the complexity as players advance through the game. This helps maintain engagement and provides a sense of accomplishment.

6. **Unique Mechanics**: Puzzle games frequently introduce unique gameplay mechanics or rules that set them apart. These mechanics contribute to the complexity and diversity of the puzzles.

7. **Story or Theme**: While not always a requirement, many puzzle games incorporate a story or thematic elements to provide context for the challenges. This can enhance the overall gaming experience and motivation for solving puzzles.

8. **Immersive Environments**: Puzzle games may be set in visually engaging and immersive environments. The design of the game world can contribute to the overall experience and may contain clues or hints for solving puzzles.

9. **Limited Resources or Moves**: Some puzzle games impose restrictions on resources, time, or the number of moves allowed. This adds an additional layer of challenge and encourages efficient problem-solving.

10. **Feedback and Rewards**: Providing feedback on progress and offering rewards for completing puzzles successfully are common features. This can include visual or auditory cues, unlocking new levels, or revealing parts of a larger narrative.

11. **Open-Ended Solutions**: Some puzzle games allow for multiple solutions or approaches to a problem. This adds replay value and encourages players to think creatively.

12. **Multiplayer or Cooperative Elements**: In some puzzle games, players can collaborate with others to solve challenges. This adds a social dimension to the puzzle-solving experience.

Ultimately, the appeal of puzzle games lies in their ability to engage players mentally, offering a challenging and rewarding experience as they overcome obstacles through clever thinking and strategy.
Use of module
Import Pygame 
 Pygame is a cross-platform set of python module designed for wrting video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries that are commonly used in game development. The Library is built on top of the simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL), which is a low-level multimedia library.  
Import sys
The `sys` module is a part of the Python Standard Library and provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter. It allows you to interact with the Python runtime environment, access command-line arguments, and perform other system-related tasks. Here are some common functionalities provided by the `sys` module:
 Import Random
The `random` module in Python is a standard library module that provides functions for generating random numbers. It is commonly used in various applications, such as simulations, games, and cryptographic systems, where randomness is needed.
